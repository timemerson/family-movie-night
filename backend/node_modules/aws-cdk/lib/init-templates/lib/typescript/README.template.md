# Welcome to your CDK TypeScript Construct Library project

You should explore the contents of this project. It demonstrates a CDK Construct Library that includes a construct (`%name.PascalCased%`)
which contains an Amazon SQS queue that is subscribed to an Amazon SNS topic.

The construct defines an interface (`%name.PascalCased%Props`) to configure the visibility timeout of the queue.

## Useful commands

* `%pm-cmd% build`   compile typescript to js
* `%pm-cmd% watch`   watch for changes and compile
* `%pm-cmd% test`    perform the jest unit tests
